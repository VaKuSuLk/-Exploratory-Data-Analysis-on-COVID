# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-COVID

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 using SQL. Created a database in SQL to analyze Covid-19
 data based on covid deaths and vaccinations over the world. Used joins, Temp Tables, aggregate functions, data
 types conversion and created views to explore global data on covid.
 
Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of COVID-19 using SQL

In this project, I created a comprehensive SQL database to analyze global COVID-19 data with a focus on deaths and vaccinations. The analysis involved several key components and techniques:

Database Creation:

Designed and implemented a relational database schema to store COVID-19 data. The database included tables for global COVID-19 cases, deaths, vaccination records, and demographic information.
Data Integration and Transformation:

Used SQL joins to combine data from different tables. This allowed for a holistic view by merging information on deaths and vaccinations with geographical and temporal data.
Applied data type conversions to ensure consistency and accuracy across various data fields, such as converting date strings into date formats and numerical values into appropriate types.
Temporary Tables and Views:

Created temporary tables to facilitate intermediate data processing and analysis. These tables were used to hold intermediate results and simplify complex queries.
Developed SQL views to encapsulate complex queries and present summarized data. These views provided a more accessible way to explore and query the data without repeatedly writing complex SQL statements.
Aggregate Functions:

Utilized aggregate functions such as SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), and GROUP BY to compute summary statistics. This included calculating total deaths, average vaccination rates, and other relevant metrics.
Analyzed trends over time and across different regions, identifying patterns and anomalies in the data.
Exploratory Analysis:

Performed various exploratory analyses to uncover insights from the data. This involved examining correlations between vaccination rates and death counts, analyzing geographical disparities, and tracking changes in trends over time.
Reporting and Visualization:

Generated SQL queries to produce reports summarizing key findings. These reports included visualizations where applicable, such as charts and graphs, to aid in the interpretation of the results.
The goal of this project was to gain a deeper understanding of the global impact of COVID-19 by leveraging SQL for data manipulation and analysis. The insights derived from this analysis aimed to inform decision-making and provide a clearer picture of the pandemic's effects across different regions and time periods.
